The Assignments under this project were done in an Energy Informatics course at the Technical University of Beirut.

The assignments range between Machine Learning, Forecasting, Optimization and Modeling. 

In some cases, multiple of these are required for a single assignment.

Libraries like Pyomo, Pandapower and others were utilized in these assignments.

The lab included competitions where we regularly placed in top 3 for all assignments except assignment 5
