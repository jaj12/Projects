This Project/Course revolved around understanding the finite volume method used to simulate thermal fluid problems. The assignments tackle creating a MATLAB code solving these problems.

The assignments build on top of each other for a 2D cartesian grid.

Assignment 1: Heat Conduction 2D
Assignment 2: Heat Convection 2D
Assignment 3: Transient Heat Transfer 2D
Assignment 4: Incompressible Flow Problems 2d

The first 3 assignment/codes work perfectly; however, the fourth one does not run but includes most of the logic for the problem to be solved.
The main script to run in each assignment is "CFD.m"
