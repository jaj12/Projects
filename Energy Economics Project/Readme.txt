This project builds on what has already been done in the Energy Efficient Building Design Project, where chilled ceiling displacement ventilation systems are compared to mixed HVAC system in order to provide similar thermal comfort needs.

The main focus of this project is the economical evaluation of both systems. 

The calculation were done using Excel and the simplified simulations of each system were done using Ansys Fluent.
