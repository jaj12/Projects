This was my final year project for my Bachelor of Engineering Mechanical Engineering Degree at the American University of Beirut.

We designed and built a rotating belt with desiccant(silica-gel) coated aluminum plates. Multiple experiments were done using our system to evaluate its efficiency while dehumidifying a room.

The presentation includes the most important information, but I unfortunetly cannot share further details for this project.
