This project revolves around designing multiple controller for a robotic arm in order to satisfy certain requirements.

The designing and simulation was done through Matlab and Simulink. 

Hardware was used to test a hardware controller. The myDAQ (microcontroller) used for the sensor was programmed used NI LABVIEW.

The report was done using Latex locally.
